		<p>This project is built using Ruby on Rails. While building this project I learned how to build CRUDable resources using rails, build authentication from scratch, and consume an API (in this case Google maps. After completing this project I felt like I had a good basic understanding of rails and how it can be used to build web applications.</p>
