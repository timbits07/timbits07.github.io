		<p>This project was also built using Ruby on Rails. I used facebook for the user login which made for a smooth user experience on initial sign up.  The most difficult part of this project was figuring out how to create a polymorphic association between the comments and either the poster or story the user was commenting on.  I also encoporated some JQuery features for the frontend.</p>
